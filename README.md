those aimbot scripts may not work, the chams script works. but its bareminimum chams, can be used in games where you want esp but dont want to use aimbot etc.
the blackjack minigame script can be used in most games, works with all executors, if the game has exploit detection it most likely cant be used in there because,
if you are injected it will autoban you. i mainly made this blackjack minigame because i was bored and got tired of waiting for games to end, so i figured, this
could be used to pass time, it runs on casino rules, soft aces, splits (when applicable), double downs, also has a credit system where you start with $1000, you can
edit the bet you want to place, its very barebones but if you want to make any improvements feel free to download and edit it(before you say anything yes its made
in chatgpt/deepseek and no i dont care because im just a skid)
